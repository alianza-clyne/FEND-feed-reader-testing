# Feed Reader Project Overview

In this project, Udacity has provided me with a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I have been tasked with using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to add test suites to the RSS Feeds.

## Why Is Testing Important?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

And this is the reason why Udacity has tasked me with this project!

## How To Run The Feed Reader Test

1. Head on over to https://github.com/alianza-clyne/feed-reader-testing.
2. Click on the "Clone or Download" button.
3. Select either the "Open In Desktop" or "Download Zip" option.
4. Double click on the index.html file so that it opens up in a web browser.
5. At the bottom of the page, you'll see a section that says "Jasmine" at the top. In this section, you'll be able to see the tests. Here is what this looks like.
